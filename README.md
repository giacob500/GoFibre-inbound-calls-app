# Inbound Calls App

This repository and its projects are built to experiment with and gain experience in using web sockets. The final goal is to deliver a complete application with the required components to streamline the work life of my team at the company where I am working. In particular, the team requires an application that dictates the turn of the person who has to answer incoming calls from customers. Thus, the application has to handle different aspects to make the process fair for every colleague.

## Repo Structure

- **chatapp**: A working chat app using WebSocket available at [https://chat-app-8rxu.onrender.com/](https://chat-app-8rxu.onrender.com/). When you open the link, the app may require a couple of minutes to load*.
- **inboundapp**: The Inbound Calls App which my colleagues and I will use once it is ready. It still requires some improvements; however, it is already available at [https://inbound-calls-app.onrender.com/](https://inbound-calls-app.onrender.com/). When you open the link, the app may require a couple of minutes to load*.
- **other folders**: Other folders such as 'chatgbt' or 'ws-1' are just experimental folders which do not affect the previously described projects. However, they work as inspiration for the two above.

### Development

- The web apps are implemented using JavaScript and Node.js. In addition, I used socket.io for the client-server connection.

### The Product

Below is a short video showcasing the chat web app. However, the final version of the inbound calls app is not ready yet, so it is not being showcased.
